        <p>I was an ordinary high school student, but on my 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, one video changes my life.<br>
            I watched one Japanese anime trailer video made for overseas. It makes me excited, and I thought I want to work in advertising production. That is why I decided to study at <abbr title= "Interactive Media Design">IMD.</abbr><br>
            It is a word that I always mention in my mind - <blockquote>Talent is something to be bloomed. -<cite>Haikyuu</cite></blockquote></p>

        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>I was a track and field athlete until high school, so I was always training outside.
            <br>However, under the influence of my friends, I got into Manga and Anime.
            <br>My favorite Manga is a <em>Jump</em>. It is one of the most famous weekly manga magazine in Japan.
            <br><em>Jump</em> contains many famous mangas such as <i>NARUTO, ONE PEACE, SLUM DUNK</i>.
            <br>This is my ranking of the animes that I think have the most beautiful animation

            <li>Violet Ever Garden</li>
            <li>Attack on Titan</li>
        </ol></p>
